# Prayers to the Holy Spirit

Holy Spirit thou who make me see everything
and show me the way to reach my
ideal, you who give me the divine gift to
forgive and forget the wrong that is
done to me and who are in all instances
in my life with me. I, in this short dialogue,
what to thank you for everything and
confirm once more that I never want to
be separated from you no matter how
great the material desires may be. I want
to be with you and my loved ones in your
perpetual glory, amen.
