            <h1>Prayer Before Exams</h1>
            <span>
            <p>Dear Jesus, today I will have my examinations, you know how important they are to me, so I am humbly asking Your gracious help and divine assistance.
                I pray to You, my dear Jesus, please never let me panic nor get nervous, just let me be ease and give my
                very best. Please never let me guess nor rely on pure luck, but enlighten my mind
                and let me think dearly. Please never let me resort
                to chances nor to dishonestly, but let me work to the fullest
                of my ability. I pray for Your guidance that as I think, I may
                find the right solutions. I may be able to correctly answer the questions, I may solve
                those difficult problems. Let me, with your help, give my best effort.
                Amen.
            </p>

                        O most loving Jesus, meek, lamb of God,
                        I, a miserable sinner salute and worship
                        the most sacred wounds on thy shoulder
                        on which thou didst bear thy heavy
                        cross which so tore thy flesh and laid
                        bare thy bones as to inflict on thee an
                        anguish greater than any other wounds
                        on thy blessed body. I adore thee
                        Oh Jesus most sorrowful. I praise and
                        glorify thee. I give thee thanks for these
                        most sacred and painful wounds.
                        Beseeching thee by the exceeding pain
                        to be merciful to me a sinner. To forgive
                        me all my mortal and venial sins, and to
                        lead me on towards heaven along the
                        way of thy cross amen.

            <span>
                <p>
                    Holy Spirit thou who make me see everything
                    and show me the way to reach my
                    ideal, you who give me the divine gift to
                    forgive and forget the wrong that is
                    done to me and who are in all instances
                    in my life with me. I, in this short dialogue,
                    want to thank you for everything and
                    confirm once more that I never want to
                    be separated from you no matter how
                    great the material desires may be. I want
                    to be with you and my loved ones in your
                    perpetual glory, amen.

                    Note: A person must pray this 3 consecutive days
                    without stating one's wish. After the 3rd day
                    your wish will be granted no matter how difficult
                    it may be. Promise to share this prayer as soon
                    as your favor has been granted.
